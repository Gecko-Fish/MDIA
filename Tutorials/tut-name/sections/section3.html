                <p>In this workflow, we will be using Runway’s text-to-image generative AI tool. To access this tool, click on the “Start with Text” button.</p>
                <p>Here you will see a text box. Type in whatever prompt you want. A prompt is the video you would like to create and what you would like the video to contain. 
    
For example, you can type
                </p>
                <div class="prompt-suggest">
                    <p>Cartoon girl looking out to the sunset in Kyoto</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <img src="media/text-box.jpg" alt="Image failed to load">
            <div>
                <p>You can also type the following to specify what kind of movement you would like the characters or the scene in your video to do.</p>
                <div class="prompt-suggest">
                    <p>Cartoon girl looking out to the sunset in Kyoto, gentle movement</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
