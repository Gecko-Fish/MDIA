                <p>There are currently 3 modes to generate videos on Runway Gen-2 (the newest version of Runway):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only Text to Video</li>
                    <li>Only Image to Video</li>
                    <li>Image + Text to Video</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below we will detail how to best prompt videos on Runway for Text to Video (These tips extend to Image + Text to Video). Currently Runway has no tips for Image to VideoThese steps are taken from the Runway Gen-2 <a href="https://help.runwayml.com/hc/en-us/articles/17329337959699-Gen-2-Prompt-Tips" target="_blank">Prompting Guide</a>.</p>

               <p><strong>What is a prompt?</strong> A prompt is what you insert into the AI generative tool (e.g. a body of text, an image, or both text and image, etc.) that instructs the AI to produce a desired outcome (e.g. a video in Runway).</p>
                <strong>Text to Video</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>This structure works well: [base prompt] in the style of [style], [aesthetic]</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Insert your text in between the [ ]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>To prompt Runway using text to video, you can type anything you want into the AI (for example, “Cartoon girl looking out to the sunset in Kyoto”) and Runway will create a video matching the body of text. Currently (as of February 28th 2024) there is no template you have to follow to generate a video using Runway.</li>
                    <li>To make your videos look better, you can use the following generic prompt modifiers (words that you can insert into your prompt that instructs the AI to enhance it). The following list is not exhaustive:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Masterpiece</li>
                            <li>Classic</li>
                            <li>Cinematic</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For more action and movement (you should specify what kinds of movement you want a certain object in your video to do), you can try adding keywords like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cinematic action</li>
                            <li>First person view</li>
                            <li>Flying</li>
                            <li>Speeding</li>
                            <li>Running</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can also <strong>use camera-specific terms</strong> (these will affect how you view the scene you want to prompt). Imagine you are videoing the scene in front of you (the scene you are prompting), depending on where you stand, how much you zoom in, etc., you will be able to view your video from a different perspective. In general, <strong>trying to explain camera movements as if you were explaining to a toddler can help</strong>; so instead of dolly shot, you would say something like zooming in over time or growing over time:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Camera angles (full shot, close up, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Lens types (macro lens, wide angle, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Camera movements (slow pan, zoom, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can explore Runway using Emojis too! Maybe it is hard for you to explain what you want the AI to do so using emojis can help you prompt more accurately</li>
                </ul>
